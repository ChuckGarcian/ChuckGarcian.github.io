Initially, it was a little jarring to adjust to the Princeton environment. From the architecture, greenery, and walkability of the campus to the culture, food, and weather of the city, everything about Princeton is different from what I am used to back in little old Texas. However, in the short few days I have been here, I can truly say I have fallen in love with it. Firstly, the people at Princeton -- and more generally, New Jersey -- are some of the nicest and most welcoming individuals I have ever met. The many times that I was lost or needed help, the Princeton locals were more than willing to assist. Secondly, the food here is like no other I have ever tasted -- and that's saying a lot since I come from Austin, which is known for its good food.

As far as work goes, I have done a lot this week. I have met my mentor, [Dr. Martonosi](https://www.princeton.edu/~mrm/), and my partner, [Ellie Vogel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ellievogel/). So far, our meetings have mainly consisted of onboarding and getting settled in, but we hope to start talking about the project more seriously next week.
