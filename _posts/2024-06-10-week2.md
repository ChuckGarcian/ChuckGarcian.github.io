title: Week 2

This week, Ellie and I started the QIS Course. At the moment, in terms of content, the course is covering Python, but I expect it to get considerably harder as we get closer to quantum content - although I'm excited for this. With that in mind, this week I plan on primarily focusing on course tasks and also pre-studying next week's content (specifically Fourier transform). However, if time permits, I hope to read/analyze Supermarq's benchmarks in a deeper manner - I want to get a better idea of what makes a good benchmark and how I can apply that to my own benchmark when the time comes to start making one.
