## About My Project

This summer, I've been collaborating with [Ellie Vogel](https://ellievogel.github.io/) and [Wei Tang](https://github.com/weiT1993) on a quantum circuit cutting framework. Our project builds upon Wei Tang's previous work, specifically his  framework. Our main contribution has been implementing a distributed version of CutQC's classical reconstruction component. With our contribution, we have been able to attain speedups on the original implementation. We have compiled our findings in a poster that will be presented at the [IEEE Quantum Week 2024](https://qce.quantum.ieee.org/2024/).

Our conference paper/poster can be found here: [Final Report](files/finalreport.pdf)
